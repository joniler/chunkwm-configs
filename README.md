Iler's chunkwm Configs
======================

What:
-----
[Chunkwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) is a tiling window manager for macOS similar to i3 or bspwm made by [koekeishiya](https://github.com/koekeishiya).

These are the config files that I have partially borrowed from a tutorial and also made some of my own personal modifications to. Check the defaults and read the docs if you have questions about the config file syntax.

Why:
----

Because it took me a second to configure this, and to add my new defaults. It may make life easier for you.

How:
----

Follow this excellent tutorial by [shihanng](https://github.com/shihanng) which you can find [here](http://hde-advent-2017.hatenadiary.jp/entry/2017/12/24/000000). He walks you through all the necessary steps needed to at least get things running, and much of my config is thanks to him. Basically all I did was add shortcuts to resize windows and move windows to secondary displays.

If I screwed anything up, let me know!
